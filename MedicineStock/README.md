# MedicationStock

The application keeps track the stock of medicines.
It is a private application and the data is stored in a json
file, using *Newtonsoft.Json*.

I started as how the *Binding* works.
The initial application worked, but it couldn't handle with the
changes.

Then I started a new experiment, using *MVVM pattern*.

It was so useful that I move the experiment to the *Tools* folder.

### Wishes and bugs

- [X] Order the medicines.
- [X] A new medicine is not saved.
