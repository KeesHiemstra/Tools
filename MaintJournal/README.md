# MaintJournal

I wanted more learn C# with Visual Studio 2017 in 2018. I used ASP.Net. I created a log system using the browser.

This experiment uses WPF to use the log system in the same way.

## MainDataGrid

An update of the list is not visible if there a focus on the `MainDataGrid`. The `SaveRecord()` forced to the focus outside of `MainDataGrid`.

## Reports

The first I added was setup the reports.

Such a report can help to cleanup the raw data.
